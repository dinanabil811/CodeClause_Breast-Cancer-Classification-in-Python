# CodeClause_Breast-Cancer-Classification-in-Python
## Breast cancer cases have been on the rise in recent years, it is essential to diagnose them at the early stage to combat it and apply preventive measures. This project's objective is to develop a breast cancer detection system in Python language by processing the IDC(Invasive Ductal Carcinoma) dataset, which provides histology images for cancer-inducing malignant cells. This system uses Convolution Neural Networks to develop the classification-based detection system.
